Self-studying École 42's legendary C programming curriculum to build unshakeable fundamentals from the ground up.

**Started:** November 1, 2025  
**Current Phase:** C Piscine (Shell & C exercises)  
**Status:** Active Learning  
**Goal:** Master systems programming fundamentals

## 🎯 What is École 42?

École 42 is a peer-to-peer programming school with **no teachers, no lectures, just projects**. Students learn by solving increasingly complex problems, reviewing each other's code, and collaborating.

**42's Philosophy:**
- Learn by doing, not by listening
- Peer-to-peer evaluation
- Project-based curriculum
- Focus on C and Unix fundamentals
- Build problem-solving resilience

**Why I'm self-studying it:**  
To build a **bulletproof foundation** in systems programming before moving to high-level languages and frameworks.

## 👨‍💻 About Me

I'm **Antonio Cardoso**, a mathematics graduate building toward a software engineering career through a **fundamentals-first approach**.

**Background:**
- 🎓 B.S. in Mathematics (logic, proofs, abstract reasoning)
- ✅ Harvard CS50-SQL (databases)
- ✅ Cisco C Programming Essentials
- 🔄 IEFP Level 4 Programming Certification (Portugal)
- ✈️ Relocating to Connecticut, USA (June 2026)

**Philosophy:**
> *"Master C, pointers, and memory—everything else becomes easier."*

Understanding how computers work at the lowest level makes Python, JavaScript, and frameworks **tools I wield with comprehension**, not just syntax I memorize.

## 📊 Current Progress

### The C Piscine (Selection Bootcamp)

The 42 Piscine is an intensive bootcamp teaching C through pure problem-solving—no lectures, just exercises.

**My Progress:**
```
Shell Exercises:    [████▱] 80% - Shell00 ✅ Complete! Starting Shell01
C Modules (00-13):  [▱▱▱▱▱▱▱▱▱▱▱▱▱▱] Not started
Rush Projects:      [▱▱▱] Not started
Exam Practice:      [█▱▱▱▱] Ongoing
```

**Current Focus:** Shell01 (Shell scripting fundamentals)

**Completed:** Shell00 (Nov 25, 2025)

**Next Up:** C00 → C01 (variables, loops, conditions)

---

## 🎯 Learning Approach

### My Self-Study Strategy

Since I'm not enrolled at an official 42 campus:

1. **Follow official project PDFs** from [42 Subjects Repository](https://github.com/Ian-Orwel/42-Cursus-Subjects)
2. **No shortcuts** — Write every line myself, no copy-paste
3. **Strict standards** — Zero memory leaks (Valgrind), Norminette compliant
4. **Public accountability** — All work documented on GitHub
5. **Community learning** — r/42Born2Code, Discord for help when stuck (concepts, not solutions)

### When I Get Stuck (48-Hour Rule)

- **Hours 0-2:** Try solving myself
- **Hours 2-6:** Debug with gdb, add prints, draw on paper
- **Hours 6-12:** Research the concept (not the solution!)
- **Hours 12-24:** Take break, sleep on it
- **Hours 24-48:** Start from scratch
- **After 48h:** Ask for help on concepts (not solutions)

---

## 🛠️ Tech Stack & Tools

**Languages:** C, Shell scripting  
**Compiler:** gcc with strict flags (`-Wall -Wextra -Werror`)  
**Tools:**
- `make` — Build automation
- `gdb` — Debugging
- `valgrind` — Memory leak detection
- `norminette` — 42's coding standard checker
- Git — Version control

**Editor:** Neovim / VSCode with Vim bindings  
**OS:** Linux (Ubuntu)

## 🗓️ Roadmap

### Phase 1: Piscine (Nov 2025 - Jan 2026)
**Goal**: Complete all Shell and C Piscine exercises

- [x] Start Piscine (Nov 1, 2025)
- [ ] Complete Shell00-01
- [ ] Complete C00-C07 (fundamentals)
- [ ] Complete C08-C13 (advanced)
- [ ] Practice exam exercises

### Phase 2: Core Projects (Feb - Apr 2026)
**Goal**: Build first major projects

- [ ] **Libft** — Build my own C library (43 functions)
- [ ] **ft_printf** — Recreate printf() with variadic functions
- [ ] **get_next_line** — File reading with static variables
- [ ] **push_swap** — Sorting algorithms with limited operations

### Phase 3: Full-Stack Transition (May - Aug 2026)
**Goal**: Apply fundamentals to modern development

- [ ] **Minishell** — Build a Unix shell (pipes, redirections, signals)
- [ ] **Philosophers** — Dining philosophers with threads/mutexes
- [ ] **Webserv** or **ft_irc** — HTTP server or IRC server from scratch

### Phase 4: C++ & Beyond (Sept 2026+)
**Goal:** Transition to high-level development

- Apply C fundamentals to modern languages
- Translate knowledge to JavaScript, TypeScript, Python
- Build full-stack applications
- Contribute to open source

## 🧮 The Mathematics Advantage

My math degree provides:

- **Abstract reasoning** for algorithm design
- **Proof-based thinking** for debugging and correctness
- **Pattern recognition** across data structures
- **Rigorous logic** for writing efficient code
- **Persistence** through difficult problems (math trains this!)

Mathematics taught me to **think in systems** and **prove correctness**—skills that translate directly to software.
