# C Piscine 🏊

The 42 School Piscine - an intensive bootcamp teaching C programming through pure problem-solving and peer learning.

**Started**: November 1, 2025  
**Duration**: Self-paced (targeting 3-4 months)  
**Status**: In Progress

## 📖 What is the Piscine?

The **Piscine** (French for "swimming pool") is 42 School's selection bootcamp. Traditionally, it's 26 days of intensive C programming where students "sink or swim."

As a self-study student, I'm following the same curriculum at my own pace, completing all exercises with the same rigor and standards as campus students.

**The Challenge**:
- ✅ No teachers, no lectures
- ✅ Learn purely by doing
- ✅ Debug with peers (or online communities)
- ✅ Every function written from scratch
- ✅ Zero tolerance for memory leaks

## 🛠️ Tools & Standards

**Compiler**: `gcc -Wall -Wextra -Werror`  
**Debugger**: gdb, lldb  
**Memory**: valgrind (zero leaks required)  
**Style**: norminette (42's strict coding standard)  
**Version Control**: Git (all work committed)

---

## 📚 Resources

- **Official Subjects**: PDFs in each exercise folder
- **42 Norms**: [norm.pdf](norm.pdf)
- **K&R Book**: "The C Programming Language"
- **Community**: r/42Born2Code, Discord
- **Testers**: Search GitHub for "[project] tester"

---

## 🎓 Learning Philosophy

**The 42 Way**:
1. **Read the subject** carefully (2-3 times)
2. **Plan on paper** before coding
3. **Code from scratch** (no copy-paste!)
4. **Test obsessively** (edge cases, NULL, limits)
5. **Zero tolerance** (memory leaks, norminette errors)
6. **Ask for concepts** (never solutions)

**The struggle IS the learning.** Every segfault teaches something.
